# "Week 6 - Introduction to Python"

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Overview  
In Week 6 of the Data Bootcamp, I focused on **Python programming, data manipulation, and analysis**. I worked with **Pandas, data visualisation, and aggregation techniques** using real-world datasets. 

## üìç Key Learnings  

### 1. **Python Fundamentals & FizzBuzz Challenge**  
- Implemented **FizzBuzz** in Python, demonstrating control flow and modular programming.  
- Tested and debugged the script to ensure correct output.  

### 2. **Data Analysis with Pandas (Student Dataset)**  
Completed multiple exercises on data handling:  
- **Loading & Exploring Data**: Read CSV files, displayed key information, and summarized statistics.  
- **Indexing & Slicing**: Selected specific rows and columns using Pandas.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Created new columns, renamed fields, and removed unnecessary data.  
- **Aggregation & Grouping**: Used `.groupby()` to calculate averages and count records per category.  
- **Advanced Operations**: Built a pivot table and sorted values for meaningful insights.  
- **Exporting Data**: Saved transformed datasets to CSV for further use.  

### 3. **GDP Data Analysis**  
- Worked with **'GDP (nominal) per Capita'** dataset to explore economic indicators.  
- Printed subsets of data and extracted specific columns for analysis.  
- Conducted group activities to **clean, analyze, and visualize GDP trends**.  
- Practiced using Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration.  

### 4. **Python Data Visualization & Additional Analysis**  
- Explored **Matplotlib & Seaborn** to visualize data trends.  
- Conducted open-ended analysis on **GDP & economic trends**.  
- Worked collaboratively on **data insights & storytelling through charts**.  

## Hands-on Tasks Completed  
- **FizzBuzz Python Challenge** (control flow & logic building).  
- **Student Dataset Analysis** (indexing, slicing, grouping, and pivot tables).  
- **GDP Per Capita Data Exploration** (data cleaning, extraction, and visualization).  
- **Team-Based Data Analysis & Python Practice** (collaborative project).  

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (interactive coding & data analysis).  
- **CSV Data Processing** (loading, transforming, and exporting data).
